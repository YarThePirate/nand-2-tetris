## Unit 0.1: The Road Ahead

As you might guess, this video doesn't have a lot of course material. It just outlines the reasons for the course and outlines what we are going to learn.

It does have a good summary of implementation vs. abstraction, however, that I'd like to record.

It says in computer science, you don't need to worry about the *how*, only about the *what*. And in this context, the *how* is the implementation, where the *what* is the abstraction. This is why most "intro to programming" courses teach you the *what* of printing to the screen, without teaching *how* that actually happens under the hood.

In other words, the abstraction is the promise of what our programming language is supposed to do. We just have to worry about the *interface* defined for the abstraction we're building on top of.

## Unit 0.2: From Nand to Hack

Nothing new here. Just an outline of how we're going to build a (simulated) hardware platform from logic gates. Specifically, logic gates built using only Nand gates. Neat.

## Unit 0.3: From Hack to Tetris

Same as Unit 0.2, except for the higher-level stuff.

## Unit 0.4: Project 0

Nothing relevant here. Just a description of Project 0, which justs tests your ability to reach the website, create a `.zip` archive and upload to Coursera.

Now the real fun begins.
